        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm Bipasha Katwal, currently pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Application (BCA). With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I'm driven by the desire to create innovative solutions that make a difference.</p>
          <p>My journey in computer applications started with a fascination for how software can transform ideas into reality. Over the years, I've developed skills in various programming languages, web development, and software engineering principles. I'm particularly interested in web development.</p>
          <p>Beyond academics, I've worked on several projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge practically. These experiences have honed my abilities in teamwork, project management, and critical thinking, preparing me for a successful career in the tech industry.</p>
          <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, exploring new technologies. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and professionals.</p>
          <p>Feel free to reach out to me at bipashakc96@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn and GitHub.</p>
